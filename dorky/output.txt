  *11.42 a.m. *

  Usually, Diary, you know how I dislike talking about my anatomy to anybody else. It just makes me feel very uncomfortable. Very vulnerable. Sometimes when I see episodes of Friends I wonder … how do these people talk about their naked bodies like this to each other? Or even about their sex lives? 

  I am sure there is some exaggeration in these TV shows. But still. How are their cultures like this? I feel uncomfortable even if Gouri opens my underwear drawer.

  Anyway. The reason I am saying this is so that you don’t feel awkward about what I am going to tell you now. 

  So I just went to the restroom fifteen minutes ago. Diary, it was undoubtedly the best visit to the toilet that I have ever made in my entire life. If there is a Guinness Book of Records entry for most satisfying trip to the toilet I swear I would immediately send an application.

  It was absolutely perfect. From beginning to end. Absolutely perfect. Like any Spielberg movie before and including Saving Private Ryan.

  First of all when I went to the bathroom it had just been cleaned by the housekeeping fellow. He exited just as I entered. It was like walking into a botanical garden full of fresh flowers.

  Secondly there was nobody else inside. Not one person. It was completely empty. And every single toilet cubicle was wide open. At a single glance I was able to confirm that I would have the bathroom entirely to myself.

  You don’t need to go to the loo, Diary. (Which is usually a blessing. But not when the trip is as magical as mine today.) Therefore you will never understand the sheer delight in finding a virgin restroom just waiting for your exploitation.

  So I chose a cubicle at random and entered. Despite the floral aromas all around me—hibiscus?—I was still somewhat apprehensive. There are so many things that can cause problems even inside a freshly cleaned toilet cubicle.

  My fears were completely unnecessary.

  The toilet paper roll was thick and fat and dry and soft and quite possibly new. The hand-held water gun hanging next to the commode was shiny, flexible and the trigger was perfectly spring-loaded. I tested it with a few quick shots into the bowl. The water was neither too hot. Nor too cold. And it shot forward at perfectly the right velocity. Last week at the gym I used the water pistol without checking first. It shot boiling hot water at 1000 kilometres per hour. I had tears in my eyes the whole evening, Diary.

  No such issues here. The pistol worked perfectly.

  Now only three things remained to be checked: the lever, the seat and last but not at all least, the bowl itself.

  All three, Diary, were in pristine working condition. This was amazing. Normally this only happens in five-star hotels just when you’ve checked in. For a few moments I just stood there to enjoy the presentation.

  Then I dropped my pants and sat down.

  Diary, sometimes when I go home on vacation I am forced to go for some family function or the other. You know how much I hate this. Funeral or first holy communion or marriage or something like that. And sometimes I end up getting stuck with a group of retired schoolteachers or bank employees and all. Who then sit and bore the fuck out of me all through the reception. Once in a while these fuckers will start talking about their bowel movements. They will share tips on what to eat, how to eat, how to lie down, how to sit … everything except how to die quietly in their sleep instead of going for receptions and irritating people.

  Many times I have listened to their toilet conversations and wanted to kill myself.

  But, Diary. I think they have a point. Maybe you need to get a little older and a little mature to appreciate this. Today I realized how a satisfying trip to the toilet can be a truly life-changing experience.

  So I sat down. And then, without a single moment’s delay … it just happened. And it happened in utter silence. Not that I had to be afraid. There was nobody else in the bathroom. I could have performed film songs loudly—I can and I have—and nobody would have noticed.

  And then just like that I was done. This is not normal. Normally I always feel like waiting for another five or ten minutes. Because I somehow feel incomplete.

  Not today. Today I knew immediately that my job was done. Mission accomplished. I flushed, washed up, got up and dressed up again. And the toilet looked exactly like how I had first encountered it.

  What magic is this?

  I was moved, Diary. Thoroughly moved. So I just put the lid of the commode down. Sat down on top of it. And decided to just relish the moment. Why can’t this happen more often, I thought to myself. In life why can’t you once in a while have a perfect day at work, a perfect day at home, a perfect day at the gym with Jesal, a perfect meeting in the office where nobody asks any questions… 

  Then I fell asleep. And woke up one hour later. When I came back Sugandh asked me where I had gone. I told him that I had gone to make a secret phone call to someone in MURPS.

  But I actually wanted to tell him about the loo trip, Diary. I really did. Don’t judge me. It is a human tendency to want to share good experiences with other people. And I am sure if I was living in a more progressive country like Japan or the Netherlands I could have casually walked up to a colleague and talked to him about my bowel movements.

  But alas we are a conservative country. And if you talk about all this they will think you are a sex criminal or something. Pity.

  So I had no option but to share this with you. A secret between a man and his Diary.

  I really hope I have days like this again.

  Back to work now. I am writing those sixty extra résumés we need to send to Tokyo. Easier to make them up rather than discuss the messy truth.

  *12.32 p.m.* 

  Tried going again. But there were two guys in the loo just standing there and chatting. Fuckers. So I washed my face and came back.
